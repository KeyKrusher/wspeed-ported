 * The next table looks magical, but it certainly is not. Its values have
 * been calculated as table[i]=8*log(i/64)/log(2) with an obvious exception
 * for i=0. This log-table converts a linear volume-scaling (0..127)
 * to a logarithmic scaling as present in the FM-synthesizer chips. So:
 *   Volume 64 = 0 db = relative volume  0 and:
 *   Volume 32 = -6 db = relative volume -8.
 * It was implemented as a table because it is only 128
 * bytes and it saves a lot of log() calculations. (RH)
