Options of intgen:
    -v, --verbose           Does verbose++.
    -b, --batch             Disables some informational texts,
                            suitable for batch working mode.
    -h, --no-vibrato        If intgen is going to write an internalformat
                            file, it does not write there any Hxx commands
                            if this option was specified.
    -q, --no-retrig         If intgen is going to write an internalformat
                            file, it does not write there any Qxx commands
                            if this option was specified.
    -r, --verify            Verifies the source .S3M -file.
                            If this option was specified, the internalformat
                            file will not be created, -sa will be ignored
                            and -v will be assumed.
    -n, --noname            If intgen is going to write an internalformat
                            file, it does not write there the song name.
                            Use this only if the memory usage is a point.
                            Normally the song name is being written
                            as a AsciiZ string to the first bytes of
                            the resulting data.
    -o, --nopt              Disables the instrument number optimization.
                            This has nothing to do with the --nes* options,
                            so effectful only if creating an internalformat
                            file.
    -sa, --nesa             Converts a NES-S3M file into selfplaying .ASM
                            file, which uses the AdLib to play. Seek for
                            the NESMusa program for more information about
                            NES-S3M files. You can find sample NES-S3M files
                            at http://iki.fi/bisqwit/nesexe/ directory.
    -sc, --nesc             Converts a NES-S3M file into selfplaying .C
                            file, which uses the Sun /dev/audio device
                            to play. Also /dev/dsp supported, and the
                            sampling rate may be changed.
    -sC, --nesC             Not only converts a NES-S3M file into a 
                            selfplaying .C file, which uses the Sun
                            /dev/audio device to play, but make a full
                            featured NES-S3M player. All references to
                            -sc in this document apply to -sC also.
    -ni, --nesil            Disables interlaced data format. This option
                            will have no effect unless -sa was specified.
                            For -sc, this option is automatic.
    -nc, --nesco            Sets the compressed data identification byte
                            value, between 0..255. Value 256 disables the
                            compression. This option has no effect unless
                            either -sa or -sc was specified. With -sc,
                            values between 128..255 are forbidden.
                            Default value: 127
    -nx, --nesxor           Sets the compressed data xorring value, between
                            0..255. Value 0 disables the xorring. This
                            option has effect only if -sa was specified
                            and the compression datavalue is not 256.
                            Default value: 255
    -no, --nescount         Selects the amount of character values that the
                            compressor uses for resulting data, in range
                            of 1..255. This is only effectful with -sc.
                            Default value: 64
    -nr, --nesroll          Selects the amount the compressor adds to the
                            character values, in range 0..255. This is only
                            effectful with -sc.
                            Default value: 154.
    -nd, --nesdepf          Selects the amount of bits that the compressor
                            uses for the distance, in range of 2..14.
                            This is only effectful for -sa and -sc.
                            This sets also neslength to 16-nesdepf.
                            Default value: 10.
    -nl, --neslength        Selects the amount of bits that the compressor
                            uses for the length, in range of 2..10.
                            This is only effectful with -sc. Don't use
                            this with -sa; I am not sure but I believe
                            it would break it down.
                            Default value: 6.
    -p, --nopat             Writes no patterns. Effectful (?) only if
                            creating an internalformat file.
    -?, --help              Shows brief list of the options.
    -V, --version           Shows version information.

If intgen finds the intgen.msg file in the directory it was
started from, it will dump its contents on the screen.

Since version 2.87, intgen can now be compiled
to work in unix environment also.

Pattern data compression (ordnum&256 == 256):

        Packed data consits of following entries:
        BYTE:what  <16=end of row
                      1..14=1..14 empty lines
                      15   =follows; BYTE=number of empty lines
                   &15=channel
                   &16=follows;  BYTE:infobyte
                   &32=follows;  BYTE:note
                                      note&128=follows; BYTE:instrument
                   &64=follows;  BYTE:volume
                   &128=follows; BYTE:command

If instrument number does not come with note, the
last instrument value for specified channel is used.
If infobyte does not come with command, assumed 00.

Pattern data compression (ordnum&256 == 0):
Same as above, but instrument byte comes always
after note, regardless of 7th bit of note.
