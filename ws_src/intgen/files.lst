Makefile            Borland make -compatible Makefile to compile intgen.
files.lst           This file
findbest.c          My program that runs intgen multiple times with -sc
                    parameter to find the most optimal compression.
intgen.c            Intgen source code
intgen.dsk          Desktop file for Borland C++ 3.1
intgen.prj          Project file for Borland C++ 3.1
intgen.gdt          Desktop file for RHIDE-1.4
intgen.gpr          Project file for RHIDE-1.4
intgen.txt          Intgen documentation
make                `cat make` was the command I used to compile intgen
                    in Linux (the files are on dos-partition on my disk,
                    and no +x -flag)
mode                `cat mode` calls Linux fbset utility to set a nice
                    screen resolution of 800x600.
bits.c              Testing bit streams...
nesplay*.c          This program is something I want the -nc
                    option of intgen to make in the future.
                    ^Written before -sc was finished.
dtales1q.c          Educational selfplayer; exactly 6000 bytes, how nice :)
                    If you have the enlighted sound daemon (esd) for unix,
                    try "dtales1q -dr46000|esdcat -b -m".
makefile.src        The global Borland make -compatible Makefile to
                    compile intgen and many other of my tools.
